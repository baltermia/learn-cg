# Learn CG M1

This is a temporary branch, testing out to see if I can configure this shit on my M1 MacBook also. 
Probably switch to some building too like CMake or Premake, time will tell.

This only serves as a note if I decide to leave this project for a few weeks again and return with no idea what the hell I was doing lol
